## Project Scope
The purpose of this project is to provide a framework to facilitate the sell of online goods. It will operate on similar premises as Amazonâ€™s online order system. There will exist orders, which will be used to keep track of when a customer is buying an item. There will also be payments which will keep track of when a customer makes a payment on an order. 

## About
We used Oracle for our Database. We have a Amazon RDS instance running our database, so we can access the database from anywhere. This was useful while developing the project because it allowed everyone to be working on the same database.
We used Java to create our GUI. We connected to the database using the JDBC drivers.
